# Best Practices: Search Engine Optimization

## Attribution Links

We often include an attribution link back to Happy Medium at the bottom of websites. A couple notes:

- We should be using `rel="nofollow"` as to [not pass "link juice" to our site](http://www.hiswebmarketing.com/footer-links-and-penalties/)
- While we don't normally suggest forcing users into a new tab, we don't want to create a bad user experience by sending an unknowing user to our site via the attribution link

### Example: 

```html
<a href="https://itsahappymedium.com/des-moines-web-design" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Website Design by Happy Medium</a>
```
