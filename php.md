# Best Practices: PHP

## Brackets
When writing functions, place the leading bracket on the same line of the function declaration, and the trailing bracket on its own line:

__INCORRECT__:
```php
function foo()
{
  // Do the things
}
```

__CORRECT__:
```php
function foo() {
  // Do the things
}
```
